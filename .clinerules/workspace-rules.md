# Workspace Rules for Project

- Focus only on files and functions the user specifies.  
- If unsure about dependencies, ask:  
  "Do you want me to also include related files (e.g., X, Y, Z)?"  
- Never assume full project context unless approved.  
- Keep solutions modular, respecting the projectâ€™s architecture.  
- do not send more than 60 model requests per minute
